	abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to illustrate the differences in salaries among the many fields of data science, which were examined using survey data from the years 2020– 2021. There are many work opportunities in the field of data science. However, a variety of jobs, around 43 different kinds of employments are in the industry. The variations further depend on the skills or software that are increasing their values in the field. The research is based on a data set taken from an open-source - "Kaggle" as well as online survey for various sites. SQL (60\%), Excel, R, and Python (90\%) are among the technologies remaining at the top of the list. According to recent reports, IT employees in the US are compensated the same salaries as healthcare workers. Some cloud computing services (such as AWS and involve a demand of 40\%) have attracted significant attention. The ecommerce department has given the highest hike which is around 15\% in the last two years. In fact, women enjoy equal involvement in the field of data science that is around 40\% better than other fields, which is also covered in this article. Despite equal involvement, women are paid less than men. To explain more specifically, visualization is the medium which is used as images works more efficiently than words.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to review the recent and existing methodologies for building a more suitable salary prediction model based on specialized skills and given job benefits in the Data Science field. The knowledge discovery also includes identifying existing human resource problems in the data science field and the most demanded skillset for early exploration and determination of input variables. As data science involves a high dimension of positions and responsibilities, the experimental dataset was projected to include skill-based and job benefits factors for more accurate salary predictions. The reviewed benchmarking machine learning methodologies on related problems are categorized into three main categories with individual strengths under different situations and requirements. Statistical methods are better in presenting variable relationships with extraordinary parameter tuning potential if linearity is present. Ensemble machine learning methods like Random Forest that combines multiple classifiers for more stable and accurate prediction. Deep learning-based neural networks have a strong specialty in handling unlabeled data and framework modifications. Moreover, it was realized that huge datasets with appropriate variables and grid search tuning method achieves greater and more reliable performance. However, extraordinary research on data science-related job benefits could be conducted if sufficient studies were present during that period. Overall, further work is necessary to determine the project’s objectives, scenario and experimental dataset to select suitable reviewed methodologies for the data science salary prediction model building.},

	abstract = {Many university students lack clear goals at the start of their academic journey, leading to a lack of motivation and active engagement in the classroom. This often results in difficulties understanding lectures, poor exam performance, and a failure to acquire essential skills. Despite this, finding a suitable job with a decent salary after graduation, particularly in data science, poses a significant challenge for university students. To enhance the motivation of data science students, we have obtained the Data Science Salaries 2023 dataset from the Kaggle website for exploring data science salaries through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Furthermore, this study aims to uncover hidden patterns and extract valuable insights to predict the success factors for higher salaries by applying Linear Regression, KNN Regression, and Decision Tree Regression Models. The findings of this study could assist both university students and data scientists in comprehending the factors contributing to higher salaries, thereby enriching their knowledge for future career endeavours.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of big data has led to a lack of jobs in the field of data science, resulting in a strong need for skilled experts to fill particular tasks in this domain. In order to get the aforementioned conclusions, an examination of the prevailing employment patterns in the field of data science was conducted, using a secondary dataset. The primary dashboard offered valuable analytics information for enhancing job security and fostering career advancement. Additionally, the study highlighted the key factors that are in high demand in the field of data science, which are crucial for constructing successful models. Various data pre-processing techniques were extensively used to effectively prepare and optimise the dataset for the stated goals of human resource analytics. The primary aim of this research is to do a thorough examination of human resource elements within the domain of data science employment. The present investigation will concentrate on the notable influence of specialised skill sets and their association with salary prediction. The results of this study demonstrate a considerable degree of precision, as seen by an 88 percent success rate achieved by the Random Forest Classifier.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic made workers suddenly change their routines and several companies adopted a remote work modality. This change quickly started to be analysed in academic literature.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to perform a scientific mapping on the theme “remote work” to highlight the prominent themes associated with the subject for 2020 and 2021, covering the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying mainly the “motor themes”, this study contributes to identify themes developed and relevant to the subjects analyzed.
METHODS: An initial sample of 479 articles published in the analyzed period was listed from the Web of Science database. After analysing these articles, 186 were selected and were analyzed by Scimat software. Journals and references were also analyzed.
RESULTS: The centrality and density indexes of the sub-themes “job-satisfaction” and “flexible-work” were more evidenced in the analysis, enabling the classification of these sub-themes directly as “motor themes”. Regarding the density index of the sub-theme, the classification “stress” was less seen. After a careful analysis of the articles content, it was verified that this is also a “motor theme”.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the three defined “motor themes”, they can be considered the most developed and important sub-themes of study in this field and, therefore, need to be well understood by new researchers in the field. In addition, these findings show that the mentioned sub-themes must be focused on by managers, considering the relevance that the literature attributes to them.},
